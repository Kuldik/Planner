# :dizzy:Hi! This is Planner project.  :dizzy:
### This project collected functionality for creating a board or task planning list, a Pomodoro timer, and a time-blocking structure for time control :godmode:
### Below you will see a presentation of the functionality in GIF  :eyes:

![Dashboard](https://github.com/Kuldik/Planner/assets/112172212/ad396dac-d078-4b39-bfd7-77d42c15ca2a)
### The Dashboard displays information about tasks, their number, how many of them were created and completed

# :calendar: Tasks :calendar:
![task](https://github.com/Kuldik/Planner/assets/112172212/01929d6f-81ec-4301-a739-50ff64d88a97)

### The task block is made in two forms, in the form of a list and in the form of a board, both options use the react hello-pangea/dnd library, which allows you to drag and drop elements from one block to another. You can create tasks, change their priority, use a checkbox to display the status of whether the task is completed or not; also, the task blocks display the task completion date, which dynamically changes depending on the block in which it is located
